                    and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on
                    your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing
                    access to the information or by disabling your Locations settings on your device. Note however,

            <p class="font_8">​</p>
            <p class="font_8">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
                Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
                data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology
                standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently
                respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to
                be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we
                will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
